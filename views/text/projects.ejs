                <h2>Political TV Ad Archive</h2>
                <p>
                    The
                    <a href="https://politicaladarchive.org/">Political TV Ad Archive</a>
                    is a project that provides a searchable, viewable, and shareable
                    online archive of 2016 political TV ads, married with fact-checking
                    and reporting citizens can trust. In partnership with trusted
                    journalism organizations, the archive provides a free service for
                    journalists, civic organizations, academics and the general public to
                    track these ads in context. The first phase of the project, covering
                    key 2016 primary elections, was funded by a $200,000 grant from the
                    <a href="https://www.newschallenge.org/">Knight News Challenge</a>, an initiative of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. The
                    Challenge was a collaboration joined by the
                    <a href="https://ritaallen.org/">Rita Allen Foundation</a>, the
                    <a href="https://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and the
                    <a href="https://hewlett.org/">Hewlett Foundation</a>.
                    The Democracy Fund also granted $49,634 to support joint trainings of
                    journalists in key primary states in partnership with the
                    <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/">American Press Institute</a>. Additional support came from personal donations from Christopher
                    Buck ($25,000) and Craig Newmark ($20,000). Project staff are
                    gathering lessons learned, which will inform planning and fundraising
                    for the second phase of the project: tracking political ads in key
                    2016 general election battleground states.

                <h2>Building Libraries Together</h2>
                <p>
                    The Internet Archive is one of the world's largest public digital
                    libraries, with an extensive collection of human culture: 2 million
                    books, 430 billion Web pages, 3 million hours of television and more.
                    However, the archive's users upload only a small percentage of these
                    materials and to preserve the world's knowledge the public should be
                    encouraged to contribute. The archive is embarking on a project to
                    make the archive.org site more community-driven by improving the tools
                    that allow people to upload, describe and organize items. With these
                    new tools, the Internet Archive hopes to democratize knowledge by
                    giving global communities the ability to save, manage and share their
                    cultural treasures for free. What Wikimedia did for encyclopedia
                    articles, the Internet Archive hopes to do for collections of media:
                    give people the tools to build library collections together and make
                    them accessible to everyone. The project is supported by a $600,000
                    grant from the
                    <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/">John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a>.

                <p>
                    OpenLibrary.org is comprised of two great parts! A free, digital
                    lending library of over 2 million eBooks that can be read in a browser
                    or downloaded for reading off-line. And, a unique project to build one
                    web page for every book ever published. Over 20 million books already
                    have a page on OpenLibrary.org
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please participate in the building of this site. It is an Open project
                    - the software is open, the data is open, the documentation is open,
                    and the site is open. Anyone can participate in this project, whether
                    you're a librarian who wants to add records of digitized books to her
                    local catalog, or you're a lover of books who wants to make sure his
                    favorites are well represented, or you just want to find a good book
                    to read for free, or you're a programmer who wants to build something
                    new on top of this data.

                <a href="/about/offline-archive"><h2>Offline Archive</h2></a>
                <p>
                    The Internet Archive's central mission is establishing "Universal
                    Access to All Knowledge," and we want to make sure that our library of
                    millions of books, journals, audio files, and video recordings is
                    available to anyone. Since lack of an internet connection is a major
                    obstacle to that goal, we created the Offline Archive project -that
                    works to make online collections available regardless of internet
                    availability.
                </p>

                    standards, the BookServer model allows a wide network of publishers,
                    booksellers, libraries, and other parties to make their catalogs of
                    books available directly to readers through their laptops, phones,
                    netbooks, or dedicated reading devices.

                <a href="/web/petabox.php"><h2>Petabox</h2></a>
                <p>
                    The PetaBox was custom-designed by Internet Archive staff to safely
                    store and process one petabyte (a million gigabytes) of information.
                    The goal was to make a storage system that was low power, high
                    density, easy to scale and maintain, and low cost. PetaBoxes are now
                    in use at major academic institutions and government agencies. The
                    Internet Archive houses more than 10 petabytes of PetaBox storage
                    technology and is expanding steadily.
